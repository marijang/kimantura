## Issues

Most of the time, if the library is not working correctly for you it is a simple
configuration issue.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infinum/media-blender
cd media-blender
npm install
```

To run the entire test suite use:

```bash
npm test
```

When developing use:

```bash
npm build
```

Be sure to use [Node LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) version!
All pull requests are tested against Node v4.6.2.

## Submitting Changes

After getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We
may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes
your pull request should be accepted quickly.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests
* Follow the existing coding style defined in the stylelint and editor config rules.
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* Write documentation for your feature

Failing to finish all the tasks will result in the PR being
rejected and you will be asked to complete it. If you don't
have enough knowlage to finish all the tasks please
say so - we will be **happy** to help you out.
